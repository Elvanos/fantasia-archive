## 0.1.6a

### Known issues

- Overusing Tags (20+ with 400+ documents in them for most) currently causes slowdowns/crashes on some PCs when using the Hierarchy tree. If you suffer from this issue, reduce the number of tags and/or objects paired underneath them.
- Importing existing project can sometimes get stuck. Restarting the app fixes this.

### Bugfixes & Optimizations

- Fixed hierarchy tree ignoring "0" value in Order fields
- Fixed a bug where the automatic relationship limter was treating single-to-many field type as single-to-single types
- Fixed a bug that was causing import/merge/repair tools to get stuck after exporting in the same popup
- Fixed an issue with flickering select menus
- Fixed functionality of the `Connected Locations` field in the `Teachings/Religious groups` document type
- Fixed a bug that waas causing the copy document functionality to also copy single-to-single and many-to-single relationships.
  - These relationships can not be copied as they are logically unique across the whole web of all relationships the user build and can exist only once in the whole system
  - Example: Bilbo has `Place of origin` set to Shire - if you make a copy of Shire, Bilbo will get automatically removed from the `Characters originated from location` in the copy of the Shire as he is already linked to the original Shire and logically couldn't have originated from two places at once.

### New features

- Added a floating Note board window
- Added new options to predefeined select lists across the app
- Added new display for non-edit mode for switch fields

- Adjusted the behavior, icon and name of the `Resume project` functionality in the menu
- Renamed "Project screen" to "Project overview" app-wide

## 0.1.6

### Known issues

- Overusing Tags (20+ with 400+ documents in them for most) currently causes slowdowns/crashes on some PCs when using the Hierarchy tree. If you suffer from this issue, reduce the number of tags and/or objects paired underneath them.
- When using the `Legacy project repair` tool, a very small amount of users report being stuck on the progress. If you suffer from the issue, restart the app and then restart the fixing process - this seems to be a workaround for now.

### Bugfixes & Optimizations

- **Massive overhaul of how data is being handled across the app!**
- Fixed buttons for moving list items up and down also showing outside of edit mode
- Fixed `Resume project` button working in instances where it shouldn't

## 0.1.5a

### Known issues

- POSSIBLY FIXED: When creating a brand new project, Fantasia Archive sometimes doesn't load the default categories in the left hierarchical tree. A temporary workaround before the issue is fixed is restarting the program - the project stays intact, can be normally edited and no data loss occurs.

### Bugfixes & Optimizations
