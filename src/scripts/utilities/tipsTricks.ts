  "The settings menu contains a whole assortment of both big and small tweaks to tailor the app to your needs!",
  "FA has a Dark Mode that is no mere afterthought and is fully serviceable!",
  "Many parts of the app react to a middle-mouse click. For example, you can close document tabs or open hierarchical tree items with it directly!",
  "Fantasia Archive is free; no strings attached: No ads, no trackers, no crypto-mining happening on your PC and all your data is all yours!",
  "If these tips annoy you, there is a switch to turn them off in the program settings.",

  "There is a roadmap of planned features on Patreon! If you are curious about what will eventually come, feel free to read it.",
  "This software is actually a local website pretending to be a desktop application! Technology is crazy!",
  "If you ever need a good, offline map-making software, look at Wonderdraft and Dungeondraft by Megasploot!",
  "The adorable little arcane dragon you might have seen while using the app is called Fantasia and she is the official mascot of FA!",
  "If you ever feel like sponsoring the development, there is Patreon. If you can't/don't want to; that is perfectly fine too - just have fun with the app and build something cool with it!",
  "DISCLAIMER: No magical creatures were harmed during the making of this software."
